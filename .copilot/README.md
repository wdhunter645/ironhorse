# GitHub Copilot Spaces Configuration

This repository has been configured to enable GitHub Copilot to work more autonomously on assigned tasks while maintaining appropriate safety measures.

## Configuration Files

### `.copilot/workspace.json`
Primary configuration file for GitHub Copilot Workspace/Spaces. This JSON file defines:

- **Auto-approval settings**: Enables automatic approval for routine tasks like code changes, file creation, and modifications
- **Workflow configuration**: Allows Copilot to execute assigned tasks without explicit approval while providing status updates
- **Communication preferences**: Ensures completion notifications and error reporting
- **Permission boundaries**: Restricts certain operations like deletions and dependency updates

### `.github/copilot-workspace.yml`
GitHub-specific YAML configuration that provides additional workspace settings for Copilot integration.

### `.copilot.yml` 
Root-level configuration file following GitHub's standard naming conventions for Copilot settings.

## Key Features

✅ **Automatic Task Execution**: Copilot can complete assigned tasks without waiting for explicit approval  
✅ **Status Updates**: Provides notifications when tasks are finished  
✅ **Clarifying Questions**: Still allows Copilot to ask questions when needed  
✅ **Safety Boundaries**: Requires approval for sensitive operations like dependency updates  
✅ **File Operation Control**: Allows creation/modification but restricts deletions  

## What Changed

Previously, Copilot would request explicit approval for most assigned tasks. With this configuration:

- Routine code changes, file creation, and modifications are auto-approved
- Copilot provides status updates upon task completion
- Clarifying questions are still permitted
- Sensitive operations (dependency updates, security changes) still require approval
- Maximum of 10 autonomous changes before requiring approval

## Excluded Operations

The following operations still require explicit approval for security:

- Dependency updates
- Configuration changes affecting security
- File deletions
- Deployment-related modifications
- Changes to `.env*` files

This configuration strikes a balance between automation and safety, allowing Copilot to work efficiently while maintaining necessary guardrails.
