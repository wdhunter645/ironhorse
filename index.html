                        <p>Henry Louis "Lou" Gehrig (June 19, 1903 – June 2, 1941) was an American professional baseball first baseman who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees (1923–1939).</p>
                        
                        <p>Gehrig was renowned for his prowess as a hitter and for his durability, which earned him the nickname "the Iron Horse". He was an All-Star seven times, a Triple Crown winner once, an American League (AL) Most Valuable Player twice, and a member of six World Series champion teams.</p>

                        <p>He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939 by special election and was the first MLB player to have his uniform number (4) retired by a team.</p>
